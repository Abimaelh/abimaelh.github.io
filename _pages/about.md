Hello! My name is Abimael. I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology and Language Science from the University of California, Irvine in June 2020. I was the lab manager for 
<a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/trueswell-lab/">The Language Learning Lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I am now at the University of Washington pursuing an M.S. in Computational Linguistics.
